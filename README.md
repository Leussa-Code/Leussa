# Photos Control Report - Field Performance Monitoring and Quality Assurance
The Photos Control Report project was designed to enhance monitoring of field meter readers by evaluating the quality and quantity of pictures captured during field activities with the use of a Meter Reading App 'MRA', 
while also assessing the performance of controllers responsible for validating these interventions. The system introduced a structured, data-driven solution.

 ### ** Problem Statement**

- Prior to this project, the organization lacked a centralized and reliable method to supervise the work of field agents due to:

- The vast operational environment and limited supervisory resources.

- The inability to perform systematic on-site controls on each installation.

- Insufficient visibility across the five commercial delegations in Douala.

- Low control validation rates and inconsistent reporting of anomalies.

This resulted in operational inefficiencies and a high risk of unreported issues.

### **Project Scope – Regional Partitioning**

To ensure accurate monitoring and a detailed breakdown of performance, the project was partitioned by commercial delegations and their agencies, covering the entire region of Douala, which is Cameroon’s economic capital and the area with the largest customer base.

The partition included the following commercial delegations:

- **Douala East

- Douala North

- Douala South

- Douala West

- Douala Center**


Each delegation contains several agencies whose performance was individually analyzed. This breakdown allowed for more precise evaluation and targeted interventions tailored to the operational challenges of each zone.

**Tools & Methods Used**

The project relied heavily on Microsoft Excel, using advanced analytical tools to automate, organize, and visualize field performance data.

✓ Pivot Tables

Segmented data by delegation, agency, meter reader, controller, date, and anomaly type.

Enabled comparative performance analysis across the five Douala delegations.


✓ Conditional Formatting

Highlighted missing photos, low-quality captures, recurring anomalies, and underperformance by delegation or agency.


✓ Lookup Functions (VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH)

Mapped agents to delegations/agencies for accurate performance attribution.


✓ Data Cleaning & Structuring

Unified datasets from sources (CMS, Manual logs).

Standardized naming conventions per delegation and agency.

**Results & Impact**

- Improved operational visibility across all five Douala delegations.

- Increased the percentage of validated field controls, despite limited physical supervision.

- Enhanced anomaly detection, leading to fewer operational errors.

- Better evaluation of both meter readers and controllers through standardized KPI dashboards.

- Strengthened management decision-making with clear delegation-level insights.
